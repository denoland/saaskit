~~Strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes

> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    + Marker character change forces new list start:
        + Ac tristique libero volutpat at
        + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
        + Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Images

![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
![Stormtroopocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")

Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax

![Alt text][id]

With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:

[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"

## Emojies

Unicode emojies are supported everywhere nowadays, use them:
[Unicode emoji list](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)

 Copy-paste from the **browser** column. Result:

 ðŸ˜€

<!-- `U+1F609`	becomes: `&#1F609;` becomes: &#1F609;  -->

## Unicode characters

&#9658;
&#767;
&#2400;

All different ways of writing should work. For example, for Euro:

`&#8364; &#x20AC; &euro;` =

&#8364; &#x20AC; &euro;
