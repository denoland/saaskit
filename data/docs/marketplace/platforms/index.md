## Platform support

Marketplace can connect to almost **any platform** via product feeds in CSV, XML
or JSON format. API's are also supported. Don't worry if your system is not
listed here, we can probably still support it.

## No Platform?

Don’t have a b2b webshop or ERP to get your data from? We got you! We provide a
backend (Magento) where you can manually upload and update your products as
well.
