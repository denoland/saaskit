To help you get your brand page up & running as quickly and smoothly as possible, we need the following from you:

* header image
* logo
* contact email address
* 'about the brand' text

Optional:

* 1x impression image
* 1x video (YouTube or Vimeo embed code)
* 4x collection impression image (from photo shoot)

Please send everything to **marketplace@fashionunited.com**.

### Header Image Requirements

The header image is scaled automatically, depending on the device the page is loaded on. To make sure the image quality meets our standard, there are minimum requirements:

**For desktop:**

* dimensions: 2560 x 526 px **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if source image quality allows it) Example: 5120 x 1052 pixels or 3840 x 789 pixels. As long as the dimensions are the same.
* resolution: 72 dpi

**For mobile:** (this is not mandatory, but for a better experience on mobile you can use these image settings)

* dimensions: 1200 x 960 px **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if source image quality allows it)
* resolution: 72 dpi

There is no need to crop the images beforehand. **We can do that for you.** Just make sure the image size is big enough to fit the header dimensions, preferably those mentioned below.

### Campaign images

Please provide up to 4 campaign images at a minimum of 72dpi and 280 x 350 pixels. **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if source image quality allows it) Example: 560 x 700 pixels or 840 x 1050 pixels. As long as the dimensions are the same.

### Logo Requirements

Please provide a logo in a vector oriented format such as .svg, .eps or .ai.

Preferably send us an .svg file. But we can also create one from the other mentioned formats. For more information see our [Logo Requirements](https://fashionunited.com/developers/logo/).
