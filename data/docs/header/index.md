## Quality Assurance

### Header Image Requirements

The header image is scaled automatically, depending on the device the page is loaded on. To make sure the image quality meets our standard, there are minimum requirements:

* dimensions: 2560 x 526 px **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if image quality allows it)
* resolution: 72 dpi

Higher resolution or bigger image size is always better in this case. Also, we can always downsize to the specified dimensions.
