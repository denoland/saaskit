## Branding Page

In order to signify a brand name from a company, we developed the Branding Page.
Here you can show people what it is like working for a company, without
interfering with the marketing for collections for that company. Also other
information about the company, such as its different labels, statistics,
history, video or images, it's all possible.

Examples: [Adidas](https://fashionunited.uk/adidas),
[Veldhoven](http://www.fashionunited.nl/veldhovengroup/),
[Peek & Cloppenburg](http://www.fashionunited.de/pc%11Peek%11Cloppenburg/),
[Grupo Cortefiel](http://www.fashionunited.es/grupo-cortefiel).

Images supplied need to be high resolution 300dpi and can be supplied in JPG,
PDF, TIFF, GIF format. Logo's are best supplied in SVG format. (see > SVG logo)

### Images

- Logo's are best supplied in SVG format. You can check this
  [link](/docs/logo/).
- Header images are best size 2200x400px. If header images are carousel, we have
  limited maximum number of 4 images.
- Other images are minimum size of 1200px wide, any height | minimum resolution
  of 72dpi | BIGGER IS ALWAYS BETTER

### Media

- We can embed videos from Youtube or Vimeo – all we need is a link and of
  course for the embedding option to be turned on for the specific video.
- We can of course link to any social media account possible. For the most
  common ones, we have logos ready for use, but if you need a link to a slightly
  lesser known medium, please supply a vector oriented logo for that as well.

### Content

- In the current template of the branding pages, we've limited the maximum
  number of tabs to 5. We strongly advise against the use of subnavigation
  because this works against better SEO results. Instead we advise to write your
  texts in such a way, that they are easily understandable and navigatable with
  the 5 tabs.

### Fonts

- If a non-standard font is used, a licenced version has to be supplied. If that
  cannot be submitted, we always use a font as similar to it as possible via
  Google Fonts.
- We have limited maximum number of different fonts to 2 in one page.

### Tips for advertorials/native promotional content on FashionUnited

_Which stories are well read?_

**1. News**\
FashionUnited is first and foremost a news platform, so our readers visit
FashionUnited mainly to stay informed and up to date. Articles are short and
to-the-point and the reader knows straight away what the text is about. At the
same time, stories never stand alone, using the tag pages or related stories
interested readers will continue reading about your brand or business. This
means that multiple short stories highlighting different angles from your
business usually work better than putting everything together in one lengthy
text.

Possible news-related stories for advertorials:

- New shop, new brand, new line, new people, new collaborations, new office, new
  technical developments, new tools;
- New clients, (retail) customers;
- New initiatives to support (retail) customers or staff.

The results of anything 'new' can also make news:\
I.e. The results of the new shop, brand, line, people, collaborations, office,
initiatives.

**2. Bestsellers and Success stories**\
FashionUnited is read by fashion professionals and fashion is their business.
Therefore, they are highly interested to read what works well for other fashion
businesses.

Possible bestseller-related stories for advertorials:

- Bestselling product, bestselling collection, bestselling (retail) customer;
- Bestselling sales person (sharing tips & tricks);
- Successful user case stories;
- Successful employee stories, showcase your own people that share their passion
  for their work and your company;
- Interesting (third party) hacks.

**3. Explainers and FAQ's**\
Similar to bestsellers, but explaining a bit more what works well for your
business to inform (and show off to) other fashion businesses / professionals.
FashionUnited also serves as a reference point for readers as well as a fact
finding or research tool.

Possible explainer stories for advertorials:

- How we improved our sustainability as a business (hurdles and successes)?
