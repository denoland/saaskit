As the year comes to an end, the IT team likes to share both recent and upcoming
updates to the FashionUnited platform in a small series of bite-sized blogposts.
We're kicking off with a visual one.

We do a lot of customization for our customers, to make their jobs look the best
on our platform. In that, we're quite unique actually, not many jobboards can do
this for them. (USP, sales team ;) As Dilan noticed some small changes could
improve looks big-time, we implemented them right away. Here's one of the first
improvements Dilan has made in her first days at FashionUnited, the examples
show jobs where you can see the difference best.
