Photoshoots, new collections, catwalks and patterns. Pictures are everywhere, in
fashion. And since FashionUnited is all about content (remember those 5C's?),
what better place to share fashion imagery?

Well, we've got the solution. Or, to be honest with you, already had. Deep down
the interwebs you're still able to find _**My FashionUnited**_ where we have the
lookbook. Up till now, over 60.000 images have been uploaded there, and the best
of all, they're all fashion-related. Quality content! The place we provide
people to do so is, you could say, a little bit outdated. And as we wanted to
use Progressive Web App technology, which is also very interesting for our other
content, we set out to build a new lookbook.
