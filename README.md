[Deno SaaSKit](https://deno.com/saaskit) is an open-sourced, highly performant
template for building your SaaS quickly and easily.

> Note: this project is in beta. Design, workflows, and user accounts are
> subject to change.

## Features

- [No build step](https://deno.com/blog/you-dont-need-a-build-step#non-building-with-deno-and-fresh)
- Deno's built-in [formatter](https://deno.land/manual/tools/formatter),
  [linter](https://deno.land/manual/tools/linter) and
  [test runner](https://deno.land/manual/basics/testing) and TypeScript support.
- Database management and user authentication with
  [Deno KV](https://deno.com/manual/runtime/kv), which provides zero config
  durable data storage. _Prefer using Supabase for data storage?
  [Check out this version of SaaSKit](https://github.com/denoland/saaskit/tree/3b1b14a97eef8859596015b22557d575d3b63c09)._
- Billing management with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
- [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) as the web framework and
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework.

   ```
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   deno task start
   ```
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to start playing with your new SaaS app.

### Set-Up Stripe (Optional)

This guide will enable test Stripe payments, the pricing page, and "Premium
user" functionality.

Before starting, you'll need:

- A [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account
- The [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install) installed and
  signed-in on your machine

To get started:

1. Navigate to the
   [**API keys** page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on the
   **Developers** dashboard.
1. In the **Standard keys** section, click **Reveal test key** on the **Secret
   key** table row.
1. Click to copy the value and paste to the `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<Stripe secret key>
   ```
1. Run the Stripe initialization script:
   ```bash
   deno task init:stripe
   ```
1. Copy the Stripe "Premium Plan" price ID to the `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_PREMIUM_PLAN_PRICE_ID=<Stripe "Premium Plan" price ID>
   ```
1. Begin
   [listening locally to Stripe events](https://stripe.com/docs/cli/listen):
   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/stripe-webhooks --events=customer.subscription.created,customer.subscription.deleted
   ```
1. Copy the **webhook signing secret** to the `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<Stripe webhook signing secret>
   ```
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   deno task start
   ```
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to start playing with your new SaaS app
   with Stripe enabled.

> Note: You can use
> [Stripe's test credit cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to make test
> payments while in Stripe's test mode.

### Bootstrap the Database (Optional)

Use the following commands to work with your local Deno KV database:

- `deno task db:seed` - Populate the database with data from the
  [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
- `deno task db:dump` - Print all database values.
- `deno task db:reset` - Reset the database. This is not recoverable.

## Customization

### Global Constants

The [utils/constants.ts](utils/constants.ts) file includes global values used
across various aspects of the codebase. Update these values according to your
needs.

### Blog

To create a new blog post, create a Markdown (`.md`) file within
[`/data/posts/`](data/posts) with the filename as the slug. E.g.
`/data/posts/hello-there.md` file will correspond to the `/blog/hello-there`
route. See [`/data/posts/`](data/posts) for examples.

Post properties are to be added to the starting Front Matter section of the
Markdown file. See the `Post` interface in [`/utils/posts.ts`](utils/posts.ts)
for a full list of properties and their types.

### Themes

You can customize theme options such as spacing, color, etc. By default, Deno
SaaSKit comes with `primary` and `secondary` colors predefined within
`twind.config.ts`. Change these values to match your desired color scheme.

## Deploying to Production

This section assumes that a
[local development environment](#getting-started-locally) has been set up.

### Authentication (OAuth)

1. [Change your OAuth app settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) to
   the following:

- `Homepage URL` = `https://{{ YOUR DOMAIN }}`
- `Authorization callback URL` = `http://{{ YOUR DOMAIN }}/callback`

### Payments (Stripe)

In order to use Stripe in production, you'll have to
[activate your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/account/activate).

Once your Stripe account is activated, simply grab the production version of the
Stripe Secret Key. That will be the value of `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in prod.

### Automate Stripe Subscription Updates via Webhooks

Keep your user's customer information up-to-date with billing changes by
[registering a webhook endpoint in Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/development/dashboard/register-webhook).

- Endpoint URL: `https://{{ YOUR DOMAIN }}/api/stripe-webhooks`
- Listen to `Events on your account`
- Select `customer.subscription.created` and `customer.subscription.deleted`

### Stripe Production Environmental Variables

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Dashboard Home (Right Side of Page) -> Secret Key (only
  revealed once)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Dashboard Home -> Developers (right side of page) ->
  Create webhook -> Click Add Endpoint
  - After Creation, redirected to new webhook page -> Signing Secret -> Reveal
- `STRIPE_PREMIUM_PLAN_PRICE_ID`: Dashboard -> Products -> Premium Tier ->
  Pricing/API ID

### Stripe Customer Portal Branding

[Set up your branding on Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding),
as the user will be taken to Stripe's checkout page when they upgrade to a
subscription.

## Deploy to Deno Deploy

Deploy your SaaS app close to your users at the edge with
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy):

1. Clone this repository for your SaaSKit project.
1. Sign into [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com) with your GitHub account.
1. Select your GitHub organization or user, repository, and branch
1. Select "Automatic" deployment mode and `main.ts` as the entry point
1. Click "Link", which will start the deployment.
1. Once the deployment is complete, click on "Settings" and add the production
   environmental variables, then hit "Save"

You should be able to visit your newly deployed SaaS.

## Deploy to any VPS with Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com) makes it easy to deploy and run your Deno app to
any virtual private server (VPS). This section will show you how to do that with
AWS Lightsail and Digital Ocean.

1. [Install Docker](https://docker.com) on your machine, which should also
   install
   [the `docker` CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

2. Create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), a registry for
   Docker container images.

> Note: the [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile), [`.dockerignore`](./.dockerignore) and
> [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) files come included with this
> repo.

The values of the environmental variables are pulled from the `.env` file.

The `DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID` variable is needed for Docker deployment of a Deno
Fresh app for caching to work properly. Its value needs to be a unique id tied
to the deployment. We recommend using the SHA1 commit hash, which can be
obtained from the following command run in the repo's root folder:

```sh
# get the SHA1 commit hash of the current branch
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Refer to these guides for using Docker to deploy Deno to specific platforms:

- [Amazon Lightsail](https://deno.land/manual/advanced/deploying_deno/aws_lightsail)
- [Digital Ocean](https://deno.land/manual/advanced/deploying_deno/digital_ocean)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://deno.land/manual/advanced/deploying_deno/google_cloud_run)

## Goals and Philosophy

For the user, the website should be fast, secure and have a design with clear
intent. Additionally, the HTML should be well-structured and indexable by search
engines. The defining metrics for these goals are:

- A perfect [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) score.
- Fully valid HTML, as measured by
  [W3C's Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

For the developer, the codebase should minimize the steps and amount of time
required to get up and running. From there, customization and extension of the
web app should be simple. The characteristics of a well-written codebase also
apply, such as:

- Easy to understand
- Modular functionality
- Clearly defined behavior with validation through tests
